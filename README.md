# Toxic-Comment-Classifier

Introduction:
With rise of social media coupled with the Covid-19 pandemic, cyberbullying has reached all time highs. We can combat this by creating models to automatically flag potentially harmful tweets as well as break down the patterns of hatred.

Objective:
Explore words and patterns associated with each type of cyberbullying
Create a multiclassification model to predict cyberbullying type
Create a binary classification model to flag potentially harmful tweets

Age;
Ethnicity;
